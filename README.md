 Daily planner

In this project I am setting out to make a planner app that is capable of set items into the localStorage and then using get method to get it back. I'll have each one saved individually depending on it's time slot. It will also be capable of classing the task into different color codes depending on whether it's in the past, present, or future using loops.
